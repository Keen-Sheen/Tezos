# Mini Kities
Kiti-zens of Earth tried to establish their own culture by making digital art and games to keep them entertained, but the problem for the kiti-zens were how they wanted to make this project come into fruition. They thought about projects like Ethereum, MATIC, & Solana, but they have found a diamond in the rough travling from nations to different planets and found Tezos(XTZ). The kiti-zens stumbled accross Tezos while on their wordly & galactic adventures. They liked the fact that Tezos is Proof of Stake (POS) and the fees on the network are low. The kiti-zens got help making a payment network on the BNB Network, but wanted to make NFT's & stake their kittie savings so it helps their population, so they chose Tezos(XTZ)!
